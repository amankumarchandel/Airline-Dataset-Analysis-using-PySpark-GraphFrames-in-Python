Because weâ€™re using graph structures, we can easily ask a number of questions that are not as intuitive as tabular structures such as finding structural motifs, airport ranking using PageRank, and shortest paths between cities.\n\n### Architecture\n- Overview\n- Tech Stack\n\n### Environment Setup\n- Databricks Community Edition Registration https://databricks.com/try-databricks?itm_data=NavBar-TryDatabricks-Trial\n- Graphframes Installation\n\n### Databricks\n- Introduction \n- Getting to know the platform\n- Cluster architecture, workers, drivers and jobs\n- Cluster Creation\n- Importing and storing data\n- dbutils\n- Spark UI, Event Logs, Driver logs and Metrics\n\n### GraphFrames\n- Graph Analysis\n- Getting started\n- Directed vs undirected edges\n- Filtering and connected components\n- Motif finding\n- TriangleCount and PageRank\n\n### Data Preparation\n- Raw Layer\n- Landing Layer\n- Building the Graph\n\n### Data Analysis & Visualization\n- Basic Queries\n- Relationships through Motif Finding\n- Airport Ranking using PageRank\n- Most popular flights\n- Top Transfer Cities\n- Breadth First Search"],"metadata":{"id":"b5cf306f","application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"Agenda","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"94f3ee44-6278-4805-8f5c-0a18e28339f9"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## <font color=blue>Architecture</font>\n### Overview\n#### Data Flow Architecture\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zhoHFsaiBeGF3FXy3oiznaPjk6uvX3T4\">\n\n### Tech Stack\n* <a href = \"https://community.cloud.databricks.com/\" >Databricks </a>\n* Spark SQL\n* Spark Graphframes"],"metadata":{"id":"44f85ac0","application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"8cbcafb3-50b8-4bc8-a6c9-7e76b15f8618"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Environment Setup\n- <a href=\"https://databricks.com/try-databricks?itm_data=NavBar-TryDatabricks-Trial\">Databricks Community Edition Registration</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/try-databricks.html\">Signup guide</a>\n- Graphframes Installation"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"846ecd3b-2521-4edb-a111-ad1af15f01e6"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Databricks\n- Introduction\n - large scale data processing for batch loads and streaming data\n - simplifies and accelerates collaborative work among data scientists, data engineers and machine learning engineers\n - offers complete analytics and machine learning algorithms and languages\n - features complete ML DevOps model life-cycle;
